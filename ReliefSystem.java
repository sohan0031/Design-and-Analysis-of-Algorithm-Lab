// Scenario: Emergency Relief Supply Distribution 
// A devastating flood has hit multiple villages in a remote area, and the government, along 
// with NGOs, is organizing an emergency relief operation. A rescue team has a limited
// capacity boat that can carry a maximum weight of W kilograms. The boat must transport 
// critical supplies, including food, medicine, and drinking water, from a relief center to the 
// affected villages. 
// Each type of relief item has: 
// ● A weight (wi) in kilograms. 
// ● Utility value (vi) indicating its importance (e.g., medicine has higher value than food). 
// ● Some items can be divided into smaller portions (e.g., food and water), while others must 
// be taken as a whole (e.g., medical kits). 
// As the logistics manager, you must: 
// 1. Implement the Fractional Knapsack algorithm to maximize the total utility value of the 
// supplies transported. 
// 2. Prioritize high-value items while considering weight constraints. 
// 3. Allow partial selection of divisible items (e.g., carrying a fraction of food packets). 
// 4. Ensure that the boat carries the most critical supplies given its weight limit W.
